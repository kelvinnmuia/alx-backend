# 0x02. i18n
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Back-end`


This project introduced me to internationalization (i18n), a process for adapting applications to support multiple languages and regions. I learned how to use localization frameworks, manage translation files, and implement dynamic content rendering to create a more inclusive and globally accessible backend application.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**0. Basic Flask app**

First you will setup a basic Flask app in `0-app.py`. Create a single `/` route and an `index.html` template that simply outputs “Welcome to ALX” as page title (`<title>`) and “Hello world” as header (`<h1>`).

  * [0-app.py](./0-app.py)
  * [templates/0-index.html](./templates/0-index.html)
